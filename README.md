# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Refactored Real Time Bus Tracker based on code from MIT xPro course

> Tracker currently shows markers for the #101 bus that services outlying parts of metro Boston
> Original code provided showed all stops on a specific section of the #1 bus, this one shows all busses on the route, in real time, using the MBTA api

### How to Run 
Copy the .css, .js, and .html files in the same directory, load the index.html file into a web browser

### Roadmap of potential improvements
I would like to change the colors of the markers to indicate which direction the bus is traveling. At the time of initial commit, this is beyond my current skills.
